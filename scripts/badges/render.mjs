/**
 * Writes a learner's badge: the SVG and the machine readable record.
 *
 * The page a learner shares is built from that record by scripts/build/site.mjs,
 * in every language of the course.
 *
 *   node scripts/badges/render.mjs --audit /tmp/audit.json --issue 42 \
 *     --trailblazer nvuillamy --trailblazer-name "Nicolas Vuillamy" --name "Nicolas Vuillamy"
 *
 * `--trailblazer-name` is the name on the Trailblazer profile and `--name` the
 * GitHub display name. The badge prefers the first and falls back to the second,
 * then to the handle.
 *
 * A badge exists the moment these two files are committed. The site only
 * renders them, so a broken Pages build never blocks an award.
 *
 * ## Everything is keyed by the Trailblazer username
 *
 * `badges/<trailblazer>.json` and
 * `badges/img/<trailblazer>-level-N.svg`, so that anything holding a Trailblazer
 * username can ask the site what that person earned, with one GET and no index
 * to walk:
 *
 *     https://sfdx-hardis-training.github.io/badges/nvuillamy.json
 *
 * The Trailhead Banner project works from a Trailblazer username, and a badge
 * filed under a GitHub login would be invisible to it. The GitHub handle stays
 * inside the record as `recipient`, because that is the thing the audit actually
 * proved.
