/**
 * Training > Simulate my teammates.
 *
 * A learner cannot review a Pull Request that lives in somebody else's
 * repository, and Level 3 rebuilds part of the branch topology, so a
 * pre-existing branch would not even share a sensible ancestor.
 *
 * This recreates the teammate branch from the patch set in scripts/simulate/,
 * and opens the Pull Request inside the learner's own fork, at the moment the
 * lab needs it. The patch sets are the same files that produced the teammate
 * Pull Requests on the public training repo, so what a learner reviews is byte
 * for byte what the screenshots show.
 *
 * A scenario says where its work goes:
 *   base        the branch the Pull Request targets (integration by default)
 *   from        the branch it is cut from (base by default): preprod for a hotfix
 *   continues   true when it is the next commit of a teammate branch that
 *               already exists, after a review: the branch is kept, the commit
 *               is added, and a Pull Request is opened into base only when there
 *               is none yet (the hotfix going back into integration)
 *   basedOn     the id of another scenario this one was written on top of: its
 *               patches anchor on lines that story added, so the branch it is
 *               cut from has to carry that story already. Lab 3.10 promotes
 *               such a story without the one under it, which is what makes its
 *               cherry-pick conflict for real. The check says which story to
 *               merge first instead of failing on a line it cannot find.
 *   offerMergeLevels
 *               the levels where merging the Pull Request is not what the lab
 *               teaches: run from their Training menu, the learner is offered to
 *               have it merged for them once its checks are green. Level 2 labs
 *               are about what comes after the merge, and a learner stuck on it
 *               never gets there. Level 3 is the release manager's, and there the
 *               review and the merge are the lesson.
