  ${c.cyan("status")}     Where am I? The level and lab you reached, and what to do next
  ${c.cyan("seed")}       Set up one of my training orgs: deploys the Helios app and its data
  ${c.cyan("check")}      Check my work: verifies the lab you just finished
  ${c.cyan("trigger")}    Trigger my workflows: pushes one line so a fork whose Actions were just enabled starts its checks
  ${c.cyan("claim")}      Claim my badge: checks the whole level, then opens the claim form filled in
  ${c.cyan("simulate")}   Simulate my teammates: creates the branches and Pull Requests a lab needs
  ${c.cyan("records")}    Create my lab records: creates the records a lab starts from, in your dev org
  ${c.cyan("publish")}    Publish my pipeline configuration: the release manager's configuration, through a Pull Request into integration
  ${c.cyan("update")}     Update my course: brings the course changes made since you forked, through a Pull Request into integration that it merges for you
  ${c.cyan("reset")}      Reset this level: puts your repository back to a known state
  ${c.cyan("teardown")}   Clean up a training org: removes the Helios app and its data

Usually you click these on the VS Code Welcome page, under ${c.bold("Training: Level 1")}, ${c.bold("Level 2")} or ${c.bold("Level 3")}.
