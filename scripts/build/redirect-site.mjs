/**
 * Builds redirect-site/, the site that keeps the old URL answering.
 *
 *   node scripts/build/redirect-site.mjs          # build it from site/
 *   node scripts/build/redirect-site.mjs --check  # prove it covers site/
 *
 * The course moved from a project site of this repository, under
 * /sfdx-hardis-training/, to its own host. The old URL is in the badge records
 * people already hold, in the Trailhead trailmixes, in the sfdx-hardis command
 * descriptions and in the VS Code extension fixtures, and none of those can be
 * recalled. So the old address keeps its Pages site, and that site is this: one
 * page per page of the course, each one sending the reader to the same page on
 * the new host.
 *
 * Two things follow from GitHub Pages being unable to answer with a redirect
 * status.
 *
 * The first is that a page here is a meta refresh and a canonical link, which is
 * all a static host can offer. Search engines read the canonical, browsers obey
 * the refresh, and the sentence in the body is there for whoever gets neither.
 *
 * The second is that whatever is fetched rather than opened cannot be redirected
 * at all, because nothing that fetches it parses HTML. Those files are copied
 * here as they are, and there are three kinds:
 *
 *   badges/       the records and their images. A badge record is an assertion
 *                 handed to a learner and read by Trailhead Banner, at a URL
 *                 nobody can recall.
 *   BACKLOG/      the story records. Every learner's fork points
 *                 genericTicketingProviderDetailsUrlBuilder at
 *                 <old site>/BACKLOG/{REF}.json, and sfdx-hardis fetches it to
 *                 write the ticket into a Pull Request comment and a DORA
 *                 report. A fork made last month still asks for it here.
 *   _assets/social/  the card a share shows. og:image was absolute on the old
 *                 site, so a link posted before the move points at it.
 *
 * It is rebuilt on every push, from the site that was just built, so the set of
 * pages it covers is the set of pages that exists. A page added to the course
 * gets its redirect in the same run, which is why there is no catch-all here.
