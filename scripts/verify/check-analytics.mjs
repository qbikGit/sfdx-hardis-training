/**
 * Answers one question: is Google Analytics still counting the people who read
 * these sites?
 *
 *   node scripts/verify/check-analytics.mjs               both live sites
 *   node scripts/verify/check-analytics.mjs <url>         one site
 *   node scripts/verify/check-analytics.mjs --local       the site/ build, served
 *
 * The GA4 property dashboard is not an answer. It shows a number, and a number
 * that halved because the tag broke looks exactly like a number that halved
 * because it was August. This opens the page in a real browser and watches for
 * the request GA4 sends when it records a page view: a call to
 * .../g/collect with the measurement id in tid=.
 *
 * Two page views are checked, because the theme counts them in two different
 * places and one of them used to be missing on the product site:
 *
 *   - the page the reader lands on, counted by the gtag("config") call the
 *     theme makes when the page loads;
 *   - the next page, reached without a reload because navigation.instant swaps
 *     the body in place, counted by the theme's location$ subscription.
 *
 * A hand written gtag.js in extra_javascript that only subscribes to location$
 * passes the second check and fails the first: location$ is a plain Subject and
 * never emits for the page that is already open, so every session's first page
 * view is lost, and a reader who lands and leaves is never counted at all.
 * That is what this script exists to catch. Both sites are configured through
 * extra.analytics instead, which the theme wires to both.
 *
 * Run it by hand, not in CI. A run is a real visit: it lands on a page and
 * follows one link, and GA4 records both. A few of those a month are noise, one
 * per Pull Request is a second set of numbers nobody asked for.
