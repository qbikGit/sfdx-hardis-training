# Lab 2.7 - Resolve a Git merge conflict with a teammate

**Level**: 2 Contributor advanced

**Time**: ~35 min

**You will**: face a real merge conflict on two files that conflict very differently, and resolve
both without losing anybody's work.

## The situation

Mariia Pyvovarchuk has been working on **US-018 - Cap the crew size a planner can assign**, in the same
flow and the same permission set as you. She merged this morning. You did not.

> Git conflicts on a Salesforce project are almost always one of two shapes: a Permission Set where
> two people added different entries, and a Flow where two people changed the logic. The first is
> mechanical. The second requires you to understand both changes.

## Before you start

- [ ] [Lab 2.6](2-6-permission-sets-and-profiles.md) finished and merged
- [ ] Nothing waiting in the **Source Control** panel that you still care about

## Steps

### 1. Start your own change

**New User Story** **(2)**, under **Project Contribution Workflow** **(1)**. Name
`US-034-crew-override`, org `helios-dev`.

![The New User Story card of the DevOps Pipeline panel](../../_assets/annotated/vscode/pipeline-cards--new-user-story.png)

In `helios-dev`:

1. Open the flow `Installation Assign Crew` and add a decision so that an installation whose roof
   type is `Flat` gets a crew of at least 3, whatever else the flow decided. Connect it to the
   **same assignment** the flow already ends on, so the new rule runs after the status change
2. On the permission set `Helios Delivery Manager`, grant edit access on
   `Installation__c.Crew_Notes__c`, so a planner can say why a crew was raised

Retrieve the flow and the permission set, commit them, and **stop there**: do not publish yet.

### 2. While you were building it, Mariia merged

Mariia does not exist. Her work does, and the training reproduces it inside **your own** fork so you
can genuinely review and merge it. Do this **after** your own change exists, because that is the
situation the lab is about: you branched, she merged, and neither of you knew about the other.

**Training: Level 2** **(1)** > **Simulate my teammates** **(2)**, from the Welcome page or from the
sfdx-hardis command list.

![The Level 2 Training menu of the sfdx-hardis command list](../../_assets/annotated/vscode/sidebar-commands-custom-menu-2--training-menu.png)

The command panel asks three questions:

| Question                               | Answer                                                  |
|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Which teammate work do you need?       | **US-018 Cap the crew size a planner can assign**       |
| Create it?                             | **Yes**                                                 |
| Merge it for you once its checks pass? | **Yes**, unless you want to merge it yourself on GitHub |

It creates the branch `training/mate-us-018-crew-capacity` from your current `integration`, commits
Mariia's changes under her name, pushes it to your fork (your own copy of the course repository on
GitHub, for example `github.com/my-username/sfdx-hardis-training`), opens the Pull Request and
prints its address.

With **Yes**, the panel waits for the checks, two to four minutes, merges the Pull Request and
writes **Pull Request merged into its base branch**. With **No**, open the address it printed, have
a look at **Files changed**, and merge it with **Squash and merge** once the checks are green: the
same clicks as [Lab 2.1](2-1-backpromote-your-teammates-work.md), step 1b, where each one has its
screenshot. If you merge it on GitHub while the panel is still waiting, it notices and stops.

Either way, Mariia is now in `integration`, and you are behind.

<details markdown="1"><summary>Under the hood: why the teammate is replayed rather than pre-existing</summary>

The command ran:

    node scripts/training.mjs simulate

which copied the files from `scripts/simulate/us-018-crew-capacity/files/` over your working tree,
committed them with Mariia's name and email, pushed the branch to **your** fork and opened the Pull
Request there with `gh pr create`.

It has to work this way. A Pull Request lives in one repository: you cannot review one that exists
in somebody else's. And a branch shipped in the repository months ago would not share a sensible
ancestor with the `integration` you have built up over five labs, so the conflict would be either
absent or absurd.

The same patch set produced the real teammate Pull Requests on the public training repository, so
what you are reviewing is byte for byte what the screenshots show.

</details>

### 3. Publish, and watch the Pull Request refuse to merge

Now publish your own change: **Save / Publish**, push, and open the Pull Request into `integration`.

GitHub shows:

> This branch has conflicts that must be resolved
> `force-app/main/default/flows/Installation_Assign_Crew.flow-meta.xml`
> `force-app/main/default/permissionsets/Helios_Delivery_Manager.permissionset-meta.xml`

Two files, two completely different kinds of problem.

Neither of them is git being awkward. Both changes are real, both are wanted, and in both files the
two of you wrote in the same place: Mariia granted a field on the permission set one line from where
you granted yours, and she connected the same assignment element in the flow to a decision of her
own. A merge tool cannot know which of two connectors should win. You can.

### 4. Bring integration into your branch

Open the **Source Control** panel, the icon of three small circles joined by lines in the left bar.

First make sure your machine knows what Mariia merged. Open the **Command Palette**: **View >
Command Palette** in the menu bar, or `Ctrl+Shift+P` (`Cmd+Shift+P` on a Mac). Type `Git: Fetch` and
pick **Git: Fetch** **(1)**. Nothing changes in your files: fetching only downloads what is new on
GitHub.

![The Command Palette filtered on Git: Fetch](../../_assets/annotated/vscode/git-palette-fetch--fetch.png)

Then the Command Palette again, type `Git: Merge`, and pick **Git: Merge...** **(1)**. The same
command is in the **...** menu at the top of the Source Control panel, under **Branch**.

![The Command Palette filtered on Git: Merge](../../_assets/annotated/vscode/git-palette-merge--merge.png)

VS Code asks which branch to bring in. Type `integration` and pick **origin/integration** **(1)**,
listed under **remote branches**: the copy of `integration` that is on GitHub, with Mariia's work in
it. Not the plain `integration` if it is listed too: that is the copy on your machine, which you
have not updated since you branched.

![The branch picker of Git: Merge..., with origin/integration](../../_assets/annotated/vscode/git-merge-pick--origin-integration.png)

Two files come back marked as conflicting. They appear in the panel under **Merge Changes** **(1)**,
each with a **!** **(2)**, and the status bar says a merge is in progress.

![The Source Control panel with the conflicting files under Merge Changes](../../_assets/annotated/vscode/git-merge-conflicts--merge-changes.png)

<details markdown="1"><summary>Under the hood: what Merge Branch ran</summary>

    git fetch origin
    git merge origin/integration

A conflict is not an error. It is git saying that two people wrote in the same place and it will not
guess which one meant it.

</details>

### 5. Resolve the permission set: take both

Click the permission set file under **Merge Changes**, then **Resolve in Merge Editor** at the
bottom right of the file. VS Code opens its merge editor: **Incoming** **(1)**, Mariia's version
from `integration`, on the left, **Current** **(2)**, yours, on the right, and the **Result** **(3)**
you are building at the bottom, which starts from the version you both branched from.

![The merge editor on the Helios Delivery Manager permission set](../../_assets/annotated/vscode/git-merge-editor--parts.png)

This one is mechanical, and you can decide it without understanding the XML: **both entries
belong**. Mariia granted one field, you granted another, and a permission set holds as many as it
needs. Keep both sides: click **Accept Incoming** **(1)** above the highlighted line of the
**Incoming** pane, then **Accept Current** **(2)** above the one of the **Current** pane.

![The merge editor, with Accept Incoming and Accept Current](../../_assets/annotated/vscode/git-merge-editor--accept-both.png)

Now read the **Result** **(1)** before anything else:

![The merge editor after both sides were accepted, with Complete Merge](../../_assets/annotated/vscode/git-merge-editor-accepted--result.png)

The editor kept both lines, and put them in the same block: one `<fieldPermissions>` with two
`<field>` lines, which Salesforce refuses. Git merges lines, not permissions. You want two complete
blocks, one per field, Mariia's `Crew_Capacity_Cap__c` first and your `Crew_Notes__c` second. Type
it in the **Result** pane: after the first `<field>` line, add the four lines that close the first
block and open the second:

```xml
        <readable>true</readable>
    </fieldPermissions>
    <fieldPermissions>
        <editable>true</editable>
```

Copy them from here: nobody is asked to write XML from memory. The under the hood section below
shows the result you are aiming at. Then click **Complete Merge** **(2)**.

**Take both** is the right answer for almost every permission set conflict. Choosing one side is how
a teammate's permission quietly disappears, and nobody notices until somebody cannot see a field.

<details markdown="1"><summary>Under the hood: what the conflict actually looked like</summary>

Git conflicts on lines, not on XML, so the markers landed inside one block rather than around two:

```xml
    <fieldPermissions>
        <editable>true</editable>
<<<<<<< HEAD
        <field>Installation__c.Crew_Notes__c</field>
=======
        <field>Installation__c.Crew_Capacity_Cap__c</field>
>>>>>>> origin/integration
        <readable>true</readable>
    </fieldPermissions>
```

Once you added the four lines, the result holds two complete blocks, in alphabetical order, which is
how Salesforce writes them anyway:

```xml
    <fieldPermissions>
        <editable>true</editable>
        <field>Installation__c.Crew_Capacity_Cap__c</field>
        <readable>true</readable>
    </fieldPermissions>
    <fieldPermissions>
        <editable>true</editable>
        <field>Installation__c.Crew_Notes__c</field>
        <readable>true</readable>
    </fieldPermissions>
```

</details>

### 6. Resolve the flow: understand both, then decide

This one you cannot resolve by taking both, because the two changes are in the same decision path.

- **Mariia's change** caps the crew at what the installation allows: never more than N
- **Your change** raises the crew to at least 3 on flat roofs: never fewer than 3

Read on their own, both are correct. Together, they can contradict each other on a flat roof whose
cap is 2.

This is the moment that matters, and the answer is not technical: **go and ask Mariia**. On a real
project, a conflict in business logic is a conversation, not a merge strategy.

For this lab, the decision has been made for you: **the cap wins**. A crew larger than the
installation allows is a safety problem; a crew of 2 on a flat roof is a slow day. Resolve so that
your minimum applies **only when it does not exceed Mariia's cap**.

Do it in Flow Builder, not in the file. A flow is stored as XML that nobody can read reliably,
developers included, and a flow that deploys but behaves wrongly is worse than one that fails.

1. Open the flow file under **Merge Changes** in the merge editor, the same way. Click **Accept
   Incoming** above each conflict of the **Incoming** pane, then **Complete Merge**: Mariia's whole
   version wins for now
2. **Save / Publish User Story** is not what you want yet. First send what the merge brought in to
   your dev org, so `helios-dev` has Mariia's field, her grant and her cap: in the **Explorer**,
   right-click the `force-app` folder, then **SFDX: Deploy This Source to Org**, the same command
   [Lab 2.5](2-5-pass-code-quality-and-apex-test-coverage.md) used on one class

   It deploys every file of the folder as it is on your machine, and nothing else. The sfdx-hardis
   **Push from local files to Salesforce org** command would send your org every change git has
   seen since the last sync, deletions included, which is more than this step needs

3. Open **Flow Builder** in the org, on `Installation_Assign_Crew`, and add your flat-roof rule
   again, **before** her cap: the flow raises a flat roof crew to three first, and her cap, which
   now runs last, has the final word
4. Come back to VS Code, bring the rebuilt flow down with **Commit changes**, and stage it in
   **Source Control**, next to the permission set. Do not commit yet: a merge ends with one commit,
   and the next step makes it

Slower to describe, much faster to do, and you can see what you are building.

<details markdown="1"><summary>Under the hood: resolving it in the file instead</summary>

If you can read flow XML and want to: take Mariia's version of the element and its connectors as the
base, re-add your flat-roof decision after her cap, and delete every conflict marker. Then publish,
which re-runs the cleaning rules over what you wrote by hand.

The risk is not that it fails. The risk is that it deploys and the decisions run in an order you did
not intend, which no check catches and no test in this project covers.

</details>

### 7. Finish the merge and re-validate

**Complete Merge** moved each file from **Merge Changes** to **Staged Changes**. When both are
there, the message box already reads `Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/integration'`: click
**Commit**, then **Sync Changes** to push.

Then **re-publish**: **Save / Publish User Story**. This matters. The merge produced XML by hand,
and publishing re-runs the cleaning rules over it and rebuilds `manifest/package.xml` from what your
branch now changes. Skipping it is how a stray conflict marker reaches a deployment.

Watch the check go green, then merge.

### 8. Verify both changes survived

In `helios-integration`:

- The flow caps the crew, Mariia's rule
- The flow raises flat-roof crews, your rule, without breaking the cap
- The permission set grants both fields

If either side is missing, the resolution lost work, and the badge audit will say so.

## What you should see

- No conflict markers anywhere: search the repository for `<<<<<<<`
- Both field permissions in `Helios_Delivery_Manager`
- Both behaviours in the flow

## If it goes wrong

**`Error parsing file: Element assignments is duplicated at this location in type Flow`.**
Your resolution left the flow with its elements out of order. A flow file groups every element of
the same kind together: all the assignments, then all the decisions. If your merge dropped a kept
element between two blocks of another kind, move it back up next to its own kind. The order inside
each group does not matter, the grouping does.

**`Element field is duplicated at this location in type PermissionSetFieldPermissions`.**
You kept both sides inside a single grant instead of keeping both grants. One `<fieldPermissions>`
block names one field: the fix is two blocks, not one block with two `<field>` lines.

**The flow will not deploy after the merge: "duplicate element name".**
You kept both sides of an element that can only exist once. Flow element names are unique. Rename or
remove one.

**You lost your change entirely.**
You accepted Mariia's side on the whole file. In the **Source Control** panel, the **...** menu >
**Branch** > **Abort Merge**, then start step 4 again.

**The check fails on a conflict marker.**
Search the whole repository for `<<<<<<<`, `=======` and `>>>>>>>`. A marker in an XML file is
sometimes syntactically tolerated by git and always fatal to Salesforce.

**You cannot untangle it at all.**
**Training: Level 2 > Reset this level**, then redo from step 1. Losing twenty minutes is better than
merging something you do not understand.

## Check your work

Welcome page > **Training: Level 2** > **Check my work**, then pick **Lab 2.7**.

The check asserts **outcomes, not procedure**: both changes present and correct on `integration`,
no markers left. However you got there, including resolving in the GitHub web editor or redoing the
work in the Flow Builder, passes.
