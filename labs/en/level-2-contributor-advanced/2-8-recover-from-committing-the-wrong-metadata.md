# Lab 2.8 - Recover from committing the wrong metadata

**Level**: 2 Contributor advanced

**Time**: ~20 min

**You will**: deliberately over-select at publish time, see what that does to a Pull Request, and
learn the two recovery paths.

## The situation

It is late, the Metadata Retriever has ninety rows, and the tick box in the header selects all of
them in one click. You take it, you retrieve, you commit, you publish, and your Pull Request now
proposes to change eighty things you have never looked at.

Nobody can review that. Worse, some of those eighty are other people's work as it existed in your
org before you refreshed, which means merging your Pull Request would quietly roll them back.

This lab is short and it is the one you will actually use.

## Before you start

- [ ] [Lab 2.7](2-7-resolve-a-git-merge-conflict.md) finished and merged
- [ ] Nothing waiting in the **Source Control** panel that you still care about

## Steps

### 1. Make the mess on purpose

**New User Story** **(2)**, under **Project Contribution Workflow** **(1)** of the DevOps Pipeline
panel. Name `US-038-installation-notes-tidy`, org `helios-dev`.

![The New User Story card of the DevOps Pipeline panel](../../_assets/annotated/vscode/pipeline-cards--new-user-story.png)

In `helios-dev`, make one small real change: on the Installation layout, move `Crew Size` above
`Install Date`.

Now open **Commit changes**, search the recent changes, and this time click the tick box in the
**table header** **(1)**, which selects every row at once. Retrieve them all, commit them all from
**Source Control**, publish and push.

### 2. Look at what you did

Look at the **Git Delta package.xml** report the publish offered: more than the one layout your story
changed. Open the Pull Request and read the diff.

At the very least there is **a Profile**, `Admin`, the System Administrator profile. The repository
carries it short, a few lines, and it came back several hundred lines longer: every field you created in
Setup since Level 1 gave that profile field-level security, and a whole-org retrieve brings all of
it along. What else comes depends on what your org went through, and
a whole-org retrieve on a real project usually carries some of it:

- **a list view** left over from an earlier story, still in your org, or a **transaction security
  policy** Salesforce created on its own
- **Apex and LWC files that differ by nothing but their last line break**: Salesforce drops it, the
  repository keeps it
- **a field whose description now reads `&apos;` where it read `'`**: the same text, spelled
  differently

None of it is your story, and some of it would travel to every org. And when your org is behind
`integration`, which it is whenever a teammate merged since your last backpromote, the same retrieve
brings their components back as they were before: the diff then reads as **deletions**, and merging
it undoes their work. That is the real damage: an over-wide selection adds noise, and it can
propose to undo work.

### 3. Recover: reset the selection

Everything else in this course is a card in a panel. This one is not: it has no card, and the only
way to reach it is the **SFDX HARDIS** view in the left bar, which lists every sfdx-hardis command
whether or not a panel exposes it.

Open it, then **CI/CD (simple)** **(1)**, then **Reset selected list of items to merge** **(2)**.

![The SFDX HARDIS command list, with the CI/CD (simple) group open](../../_assets/annotated/vscode/sidebar.png)

It does more than its name suggests, and knowing exactly what saves you from undoing it twice. In
one pass it:

1. **Undoes every commit** your branch has made since it left `integration`, without touching a
   single file. The commits go, your changes stay, in front of you, as if you had never published
2. **Clears what was queued for the next commit**, so nothing is waiting
3. **Restores `manifest/package.xml` and `manifest/destructiveChanges.xml`** to the versions on the
   branch point, which is what actually clears the selection
4. **Marks your branch as safe to overwrite on GitHub**, because what you have locally no longer
   matches what you pushed

It asks you to confirm the reset first, and it refuses outright if you are standing on the branch
you were going to merge into.

So after this one command, the over-wide commit is gone and the layout move is back in front of you,
uncommitted, in the **Source Control** panel. Nothing of yours is lost: the change is in Salesforce,
and the file is still on your disk.

### 4. Deal with what you already pushed

**Nothing to click in this step.** It is a decision to make before step 5, and in this lab it is
already made for you: nobody has reviewed your Pull Request, so you are in the first case below,
and step 5 does what it says. Read the second case anyway, it is the one a real project will put
you in.

Locally you are clean. The branch on GitHub is not: it still carries the over-wide commit, because
the reset only changed the copy on your machine.

**Nobody has reviewed it** (the normal case, and yours here): the corrected branch goes over it when
you publish again in step 5. That is what the reset authorised, and the publish does it without
asking. The mistake disappears from the history as though it never happened, which on your own
feature branch before review is exactly what you want.

**Somebody has already reviewed it**, or the branch is shared: do not force push. Rewriting history
under a reviewer is how a review comment ends up attached to a commit that no longer exists. Commit
the corrected state as a new commit instead, so the diff shows the mistake and its correction, both
visible.

!!! danger "Force pushing is for a branch only you have touched"
    The rule is not about git, it is about people. Ask one question: has anyone else pulled this
    branch, or commented on it? If yes, the history is shared and you add to it. If no, it is yours
    and you can tidy it.

### 5. Publish again, properly

Everything the retrieve brought down is still in your files, uncommitted. In the **Source
Control** panel, stage **one file only**, the layout. Commit it, then discard the rest: right-click
**Changes**, **Discard All Changes**.

Then **Save / Publish** **(1)** again.

![The Save / Publish card of the DevOps Pipeline panel](../../_assets/annotated/vscode/pipeline-cards--save-publish.png)

The **Git Delta package.xml** report now names one component, the layout, and the publish pushes
over the old branch without asking: the reset authorised it. The Pull Request now shows one file,
your layout.

### 6. The habit that prevents this

Three checks, each about ten seconds, before every push:

1. **Read the Git Delta package.xml report.** If it has entries you cannot explain, stop
2. **Count the files in the Source Control panel.** A one-field story is two to four files. Eighty
   is never right
3. **Skim the diff for deletions.** Additions are usually yours. Deletions are usually somebody
   else's

<details markdown="1"><summary>Under the hood: what "the selection" actually is</summary>

The command behind the menu entry is:

    sf hardis:work:resetselection

There is no list of ticked items stored anywhere. **Your selection is your commits.** What you chose
in the Metadata Retriever became files, the files you committed became the branch, and
`hardis:work:save` works out the delta from the git diff between that branch and the target branch,
and adds it to `manifest/package.xml`. Select too much and the diff is too wide, because the diff is all there is.

That is why the fix has to touch git, and why this command does exactly three things:

    git reset --soft <branch point>            undo the commits, keep every file
    git checkout <branch point> -- manifest/   put package.xml back as it was
    setConfig('user', { canForcePush: true })  authorize the next push to rewrite the branch

Nothing touches your org, and nothing touches your files.

The reason an over-wide selection produces deletions is worth stating plainly. If your org is behind
`integration` and you retrieve everything from it, the retrieved files are older than what is on
`integration`, and the diff reads as "remove what they added". A backpromote before starting
([Lab 2.1](2-1-backpromote-your-teammates-work.md)) is what prevents that.

## What you should see

- The **Git Delta package.xml** report naming a single `Layout`
- A Pull Request diff of one file: the layout
- Your layout change still present in `helios-dev`

## If it goes wrong

**The reset says you have changes waiting.**
Publish them or discard them in the **Source Control** panel first, then run the reset again.

**After the new publish, the Git Delta report still names several components.**
You committed more than the layout after the reset. Everything the retrieve brought down is still in
your files, and only what you commit goes into the package: reset again, and stage one file.

**You already merged the bad Pull Request.**
Revert it on `integration` with the **Revert** button GitHub offers on a merged Pull Request, then
redo the story properly. Do not try to fix `integration` by hand.
