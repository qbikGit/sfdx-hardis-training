# Lab 2.4 - Ship reference data and a batch with deployment actions

**Level**: 2 Contributor advanced

**Time**: ~30 min

**You will**: meet the worst kind of failure, the one where nothing fails, and fix it with three
deployment actions of three different kinds.

## The situation

> **US-026 - Crew capacity reference data and nightly recalculation**
>
> As a planner, I want capacity rules per crew type and a nightly job that recalculates them, so
> that the planning board is right every morning and I get a summary of it in my inbox.
>
> Acceptance criteria:
>
> - 12 Crew Capacity records exist in every org
> - The batch is scheduled nightly
> - The planner receives the morning summary email

You build it, the deployment is green, everyone signs it off, and three weeks later a planner says
the board has never updated. The metadata arrived. Nothing else did.

**A deployment carries metadata. It does not carry records, it does not carry scheduled jobs, and
it does not carry anything a human had to click in Setup.** Every one of those has to be declared,
or it happens once in your org and nowhere else, forever.

## Before you start

- [ ] [Lab 2.3](2-3-fix-broken-records-with-an-apex-deployment-action.md) finished and merged
- [ ] `helios-dev` level with `integration`

## Steps

### 1. Take the story and build the metadata

**New User Story** **(2)**, under **Project Contribution Workflow** **(1)** of the DevOps Pipeline
panel. Name `US-026-crew-capacity-data`, org `helios-dev`.

![The New User Story card of the DevOps Pipeline panel](../../_assets/annotated/vscode/pipeline-cards--new-user-story.png)

In `helios-dev`, create:

- A custom object **Crew Capacity** (`Crew_Capacity__c`), with:
  - `External_Id__c`, Text 40, **External Id**, **Unique**
  - `Crew_Type__c`, Picklist: `Roof`, `Ground`, `Electrical`
  - `Roof_Type__c`, Picklist: `Tile`, `Slate`, `Flat`, `Metal`
  - `Panels_Per_Day__c`, Number 3,0
- A tab for it, so the records can be found in the app: **Setup > Tabs**, **New** under **Custom
  Object Tabs**, object **Crew Capacity**, any tab style. Keep the profile visibility the wizard
  offers. On the last screen, **Add to Custom Apps**, untick **Include Tab** at the top of the list,
  then tick **Helios Delivery** alone: the other apps have no use for it
- An Apex class `CrewCapacityBatch` that recalculates `Total_Capacity_kW__c` on planned
  installations and that Salesforce can run on a schedule, plus its test class
  `CrewCapacityBatchTest`. **You do not have to write these.** Copy them from
  `scripts/apex/samples/` in the repository: what they compute matters far less here than the fact
  that somebody has to schedule them in every org, which is the whole point of the lab
- The access, on **Helios Delivery Manager**: **Read**, **Create** and **Edit** on Crew Capacity,
  **Read** and **Edit** on its four fields, and under **Tab Settings** on the same page, **Available**
  and **Visible**. Planners maintain these numbers, and it is also the permission set the pipeline's
  own user holds in every org: without it the data load of step 4 would find fields it is not
  allowed to write. The tab setting is what shows the tab in the other orgs, where the profile
  visibility you kept in the wizard never travels

Then the records. Helios supports 12 combinations, three crew types by four roof types, and each
one needs a Crew Capacity record saying how many panels a day that crew lays on that roof. Typing
twelve records teaches nothing this lab is about, so the Training menu creates them:
**Training: Level 2** **(1)** > **Create my lab records** **(2)**, pick **Lab 2.4 - the 12 Crew
Capacity records**, then **helios-dev**, and answer **Yes** to **Create them?**.

![The Level 2 Training menu, with Create my lab records](../../_assets/annotated/vscode/sidebar-commands-custom-menu-2--lab-records.png)

The panel first checks that your object and its four fields are in the org, then creates the
records, lists them, and ends with a **See them in the org** link. Open it, or open the **Crew
Capacity** tab of the Helios Delivery app and pick the **All** list view: it reads **12 items**
**(1)**, from `CAP-ROOF-TILE` to `CAP-ELECTRICAL-METAL`. If the
panel says a field is missing, finish the object first, then run it again: it updates the same
twelve records rather than creating more.

![The All list of Crew Capacity in helios-dev, with its 12 records](../../_assets/annotated/salesforce/crew-capacity-records.png)

<details markdown="1"><summary>Under the hood: how the records were created</summary>

The menu entry ran:

    node scripts/training.mjs records

which loaded `scripts/lab-records/lab-2-4/Crew_Capacity__c.csv` into `helios-dev` with
`sf data upsert bulk`, matching on `External_Id__c`, and added an **All** list view to the object
when it had none, so the link has a list to open. On a real project somebody enters these
records in the org, or loads them from a spreadsheet: either way they exist in one org only, which
is the problem the rest of this lab solves.

</details>

### 2. Publish and watch nothing fail

Retrieve the object, its fields, its tab, the `Helios_Delivery` app, the two Apex classes and
`Helios_Delivery_Manager` with **Commit changes**, commit them, then **Save / Publish**, push, Pull
Request. The check is green. Merge. The deployment is green.

Now open `helios-integration` and look:

- The **Crew Capacity** tab is in the Helios Delivery app, **with zero records**
- `CrewCapacityBatch` exists, **scheduled nowhere**
- Nobody checked that the org is allowed to send the batch's summary email

The feature is in the org and completely inert. This is worse than a failure, because a failure
tells you.

### 3. Build a data workspace for the reference records

The story is merged, so what is missing goes into a second Pull Request for the same story. **New
User Story**, name `US-026-crew-capacity-actions`, org `helios-dev`: a follow-up branch is how a
team finishes a story, and sfdx-hardis says it itself at the end of every Save / Publish, **do not
reuse the same branch**.

On the Welcome page, click **Data Workbench**. The panel that opens is titled **Data
Import/Export Workbench**. **Create Workspace** **(1)** sits at the top right, and the workspaces
the project already carries are listed on the left **(2)**: `HeliosBaseline` is the one the Training
menu uses to seed your org.

A workspace is a folder of CSV files plus the recipe that says which object each one fills and how.
It is run by [SFDMU](https://github.com/forcedotcom/SFDX-Data-Move-Utility), the data loader
sfdx-hardis uses, and nothing in it is specific to one org.

![The Data Import/Export Workbench, where SFDMU workspaces are created and run](../../_assets/annotated/vscode/data-workbench.png)

The picture was taken at the end of this step, so it already lists `HeliosCrewRefData` under
`HeliosBaseline`. Yours lists `HeliosBaseline` alone until you create it.

Create a new workspace:

1. **Create Workspace** **(1)**, and fill in its three fields:
   - **Workspace Name**: `HeliosCrewRefData`, the name of its folder under `scripts/data/`
   - **Display Label**: `Crew capacity reference data`, the name the panels show, for example when
     you pick this workspace in a deployment action in step 4
   - **Description**: `The 12 Crew Capacity records every org needs: panels a day per crew type and
     roof type.`
2. **Add Object**, and paste this into **SOQL Query**. It names the object and the four fields you
   created:

    ```sql
    SELECT External_Id__c, Crew_Type__c, Roof_Type__c, Panels_Per_Day__c FROM Crew_Capacity__c
    ```

3. **Operation**: **Upsert**
4. **External Id (for Upsert)**: `External_Id__c`

Then **Export data**. It asks two questions: whether to use your default org, `helios-dev`, and
whether you confirm the export. Yes to both. The panel pulls your 12 records into
`scripts/data/HeliosCrewRefData/Crew_Capacity__c.csv`.

Open that file **(1)** and read it. Twelve rows, one column per field, each with a stable external
id **(3)**, and an `Id` column first **(2)**: the record ids of `helios-dev`, which mean nothing anywhere else and which
the import ignores, because it matches on the external id. That file is now versioned, reviewed
and deployed like any other source. The `logs`, `reports` and `target` folders the export also
wrote next to it are git-ignored: nothing to commit there.

![The exported Crew_Capacity__c.csv, open in the editor](../../_assets/annotated/vscode/editor-crew-capacity-csv.png)

!!! tip "Why the external id is not optional"
    `Upsert` on `External_Id__c` means running the import twice updates the same twelve records
    instead of creating twelve more. Without a stable external id the import is not repeatable, and
    an import that is not repeatable cannot be part of a pipeline.

### 4. Declare the three actions

Actions belong to a Pull Request, so it has to exist first: commit the workspace, its
`export.json` and the CSV file, **Save / Publish**, and open the Pull Request. Then open it in the
**DevOps Pipeline** panel, **Deployment Actions** tab, and add three.

**One: load the reference data.**

![The Edit Deployment Action dialog, with the Data type selected](../../_assets/annotated/vscode/pipeline-edit-action-data.png)

| Field              | Value                               |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Type               | **Data**                            |
| Label              | `Load crew capacity reference data` |
| When               | After Metadata Deployment           |
| SFDMU Project Path | `HeliosCrewRefData`                 |
| Execution Contexts | Deployment job only                 |
| Target orgs        | All target orgs                     |

**Deployment job only**, not both jobs, because a validation job is a rehearsal: it checks the
metadata and changes nothing. An import writes records for real, so it has no business running
during a check.

**Type** **(1)** decides which fields the rest of the dialog shows. **SFDMU Project Path** **(2)**
is a dropdown of the workspaces under `scripts/data/`, so it names `HeliosCrewRefData` rather than
its path. **Target orgs** **(3)** on **All target orgs** means every org the pipeline deploys to.

**Two: schedule the batch.**

![The Edit Deployment Action dialog, with the Schedule Batch type selected](../../_assets/annotated/vscode/pipeline-edit-action-schedule-batch.png)

| Field                         | Value                                              |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Type                          | **Schedule Batch**                                 |
| Label                         | `Schedule the nightly crew capacity recalculation` |
| Apex Class Name               | `CrewCapacityBatch`                                |
| Cron Expression               | `0 0 2 * * ?` (every night at 02:00)               |
| Scheduled Job Name (Optional) | `Helios crew capacity nightly`                     |
| Run Only Once By Org          | yes                                                |

**Schedule Batch** **(1)** replaces the script field with two of its own: **Apex Class Name**
**(2)**, a dropdown of the schedulable classes in the project, and **Cron Expression** **(3)**,
which the dialog explains with examples under the field.

**Three: the one nobody can automate.**

![The Edit Deployment Action dialog, with the Manual type selected](../../_assets/annotated/vscode/pipeline-edit-action-manual.png)

Some things have no API. Email deliverability is the best known one: whether an org may send
email at all is a setting in Setup that no deployment can change. The batch emails the planner a
summary when it finishes, and in an org where deliverability is not **All email**, that email is
dropped without a word.

| Field        | Value                                   |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Type         | **Manual**                              |
| Label        | `Set Email Deliverability to All Email` |
| When         | **Before Metadata Deployment**          |
| Instructions | the four numbered lines below           |
| Target orgs  | All target orgs                         |

```
1. Open **Setup**, type `Deliverability` in the Quick Find box, and open it.
2. Under **Access to Send Email**, set **Access level** to **All email**.
3. Click **Save**.
4. Check: the page reads **All email**. If it already did, there is nothing to do.
```

On your scratch orgs it already reads **All email**, so the step takes ten seconds. On a real
project it is the step people forget: every sandbox refresh puts a sandbox back to **System email
only**, and the first sign of it is a planner asking why the summary stopped arriving.

**Manual** **(1)** leaves one field that matters, **Instructions** **(2)**, a multi-line box that
takes Markdown: number the clicks, and finish with what the person should see afterwards.
**Target orgs** **(3)** stays on **All target orgs**, because this click is needed in every org.

**When** is **Before Metadata Deployment**, unlike the two others. The org must be allowed to send
email before anything that sends one arrives in it, so the person merging does this click first,
then merges. A manual step declared before the deployment is listed first in the Pull Request
comment, which is where they read it.

A manual step does not do anything. It **appears in the Pull Request comment and in the deployment
report**, so the person releasing to production is told, in the release itself, that there is a
click to make. That is the difference between a manual step that gets done and one that lives in a
Confluence page nobody opens.

So write it for somebody who has never seen your story: every click, in order, with the exact names
on the screen, and what the page shows when it is done, like the four lines above. The release
manager does it in an org you have never opened, often on release day. If they have to guess what
you meant, they will guess, and a wrong guess in production is worse than no step at all.

### 5. Read the Pull Request comment

The editor wrote the three actions into `scripts/actions/`, in a file named after your Pull Request.
Commit it, **Save / Publish**.

When the check finishes, sfdx-hardis posts a **Deployment Actions** comment on the Pull Request:

![The Deployment Actions comment of the US-026 Pull Request](../../_assets/annotated/web/github-pr-deployment-actions.png)

- **Pending manual actions** **(1)**: your deliverability step, with a checkbox, for `integration`.
  Do the click in the org, then tick the box: the next job records it as done
- **Status by org branch** **(2)**: one row per action, with its moment. The deliverability step,
  **pre-deploy**, waits for somebody; the import and the schedule, **post-deploy**, are marked
  **skipped**, because a check changes nothing

Merge, and watch the deployment job: the data import runs, the batch gets scheduled, and the manual
step stays pending until a person says it is done.

### 6. Verify in the integration org

Do not take the green tick for it. **Open the org and look:**

- The **Crew Capacity** tab of the Helios Delivery app, on its **All** list view, has 12 records
- **Setup > Scheduled Jobs** lists `Helios crew capacity nightly`
- The manual step is listed as still to do, because you have not done it

Do the manual step by hand in `helios-integration`, then tick its box under **Pending manual
actions** in the comment on your Pull Request. A job reads the boxes of the Pull Requests it
deploys, so this tick is recorded by the next job that carries US-026: the promotion to `uat` in
[Lab 3.5](../level-3-release-manager/3-5-promote-to-uat-and-write-release-notes.md). Until then its row under **Status by org branch** still reads waiting, and
that is expected. On a real release the person merging does the click and ticks the box before
merging, and the deployment job records it at once. That is the point: you did it **because the
pipeline told you to**, not because you remembered.

!!! warning "If the records are not there and the job was green"
    Read the deployment log for the line **Listing Post-deployment actions**. When it is followed by
    *No post-deployment actions defined*, the actions were never found, and the deployment happily
    carried on without them.

    That happened for real while this course was being written. The CI job could not read its own
    git history, so the tool could not work out which Pull Requests the merge carried, and it
    reported no actions rather than a failure. It is fixed in this project, and sfdx-hardis now
    stops instead of carrying on. The habit it leaves behind is the one worth keeping: when a
    feature arrives empty, read the log for that line before you blame the import.

!!! danger "A data import succeeds when the object is missing"
    This one is worth knowing for the rest of your career, because it is SFDMU behaving as designed
    and it looks exactly like success:

    ```
    [WARNING] Describe failed for {Crew_Capacity__c}: The requested resource does not exist
    [WARNING] {Crew_Capacity__c} is missing in the Target.
    [WARNING] {Crew_Capacity__c} Object will be excluded from the process.
    [WARNING] Object set 1 has no objects to process after validation. Skipping.
    ===== MIGRATION JOB ENDED =====
    Command succeeded.
    Exit code 0 (SUCCESS).
    ```

    **Exit code 0.** The action is reported as run, the job is green, and not one record was
    written. If the object never reached the org, for any reason, the import that was supposed to
    fill it says nothing louder than a warning nobody reads.

    That is why the check in this step is the records and not the tick, and it is why those two
    `WARNING` lines are worth searching for in a deployment log when a feature arrives empty.

The habit behind all of this: **a green deployment is evidence that the metadata went in, and
evidence of nothing else.** The org is the only thing that tells you an action ran.

<details markdown="1"><summary>Under the hood: the three action types</summary>

All three are entries in the same YAML file under `scripts/actions/`:

    commandsPreDeploy:
      - id: email-deliverability
        label: Set Email Deliverability to All Email
        type: manual
        parameters:
          instructions: |
            1. Open **Setup**, type `Deliverability` in the Quick Find box, and open it.
            ...
    commandsPostDeploy:
      - id: load-crew-capacity
        label: Load crew capacity reference data
        type: data
        parameters:
          sfdmuProject: HeliosCrewRefData
        context: process-deployment-only
      - id: schedule-crew-capacity
        label: Schedule the nightly crew capacity recalculation
        type: schedule-batch
        parameters:
          className: CrewCapacityBatch
          cronExpression: "0 0 2 * * ?"
          jobName: Helios crew capacity nightly
        context: process-deployment-only
        runOnlyOnceByOrg: true

The data import runs SFDMU through `sf hardis:org:data:import`, the same command the Training menu
uses to seed your org. The schedule action runs anonymous Apex that calls `System.schedule`. The
manual action runs nothing at all and only produces text.

Note what they have in common: **they are files in the repository, reviewed in a Pull Request,
replayed identically in every org.** A colleague can read the diff and see that this story needs
data, a job and a click, which is information that otherwise exists only in the head of whoever
built it.

## What you should see

- Twelve Crew Capacity records in `helios-integration`
- `Helios crew capacity nightly` in **Setup > Scheduled Jobs**
- The manual step listed in the deployment report, ticked off by you

## If it goes wrong

**The Crew Capacity tab is missing from the app in `helios-integration`.**
Either the tab or the `Helios_Delivery` app was not in your Pull Request, or the tab is not
**Visible** under **Tab Settings** of `Helios_Delivery_Manager`. The profile visibility you set in
the wizard stays in `helios-dev`. Fix it there, retrieve the missing piece, and publish again.

**The data import fails on field level security.**
The CI user cannot write the fields: the grant of step 1 is missing from `Helios_Delivery_Manager`,
or never reached the repository. A deployment grants no field permissions to anybody by itself. Add
them in `helios-dev`, retrieve the permission set, and publish again.

**The import creates duplicates every run.**
The operation is `Insert`, not `Upsert`, or the external id is not set. Open the workspace in the
**Data Workbench** panel and correct both there.

**The schedule action fails with `Invalid cron expression`.**
Salesforce cron has seconds and a day-of-week field: `0 0 2 * * ?`, not `0 2 * * *`.

**The batch is scheduled twice.**
`runOnlyOnceByOrg` is unticked and the deployment ran twice. Delete the duplicate in **Setup >
Scheduled Jobs** and tick it.
