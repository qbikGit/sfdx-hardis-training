# Lab 3.7 - Production is broken: hotfix and retrofit

**Level**: 3 Release Manager

**Time**: ~35 min

**You will**: take one broken formula from production to a fix that is live, then bring that fix
back down into the pipeline so nothing undoes it.

## The situation

**17:40 on a Friday.** Planners close the week by cancelling the installations the crews could not
reach and back-dating them to the day the job was called off. Every one of those saves is refused.

The formula of the `Installation_Date_Not_Past` validation rule exempts installations that are
`Completed` and says nothing about the ones that are `Cancelled`, so a job that will never happen is
being held to a rule about scheduling it. It is one missing condition, and it is stopping the
planners from closing their week.

**A hotfix does not skip the pipeline.** It enters it further along. An ordinary story starts on
`integration` and travels `integration` to `uat` to `preprod` to `main`. A hotfix starts on
`preprod`, the branch that holds exactly what production runs, and travels `preprod` to `main`. Same
branches, same protection, same checks, same deployment jobs. Only the entry point differs, which is
why [Lab 3.1](3-1-configure-the-pipeline-up-to-production.md) put `preprod` in `availableTargetBranches`.

One thing follows from that, and Part 3 is about it: `uat` and `integration` never saw the commit,
so the next release from `integration` would deploy the old formula over the fix and bring the
incident back. Bringing `main` back down is the **retrofit**, and it is not optional.

## Before you start

- [ ] [Lab 3.6](3-6-release-to-production-and-read-dora-metrics.md) finished: the release is in production
- [ ] `helios-preprod` and `helios-prod` connected in **Orgs Manager**
- [ ] Nothing waiting in the **Source Control** panel that you still care about

## Part 1: the fix

### 1. See what is broken, in production

Open `helios-prod` and look at the rule itself: **Setup > Object Manager > Installation >
Validation Rules** **(1)**, then `Installation_Date_Not_Past` **(2)**.

![The validation rules of Installation in Setup](../../_assets/annotated/salesforce/validation-rule.png)

Its formula today:

```
AND(
  ISCHANGED(Install_Date__c),
  Install_Date__c < TODAY(),
  NOT(ISPICKVAL(Status__c, "Completed"))
)
```

Three conditions, and two of them already did their job. `ISCHANGED` is why an old record can still
be saved as long as nobody touches the date, and the `Completed` exemption is why a finished job can
be dated when it actually happened. Whoever wrote this thought about it. They just wrote the list of
exceptions before anybody had invented a second way of being an exception.

**Confirm it before you call it an incident.** Open any installation in `helios-prod`, set its
status to `Cancelled`, put yesterday's date in **Install Date**, and save. The error message in the
picture above is what you get. That is the report reproduced, on the real org, in thirty seconds.

### 2. The developer branches the fix from preprod

The fix is Romain's to write, not yours: a release manager reviews and ships what contributors send,
and does not write their features. **Training: Level 3** > **Simulate my teammates**, and pick
**US-045 Hotfix: cancelled installations can be back-dated again**.

![The Level 3 training menu on the Welcome page](../../_assets/annotated/vscode/welcome-custom-menu-3.png)

It opens his Pull Request from `fix/US-045-installation-date-hotfix` into **`preprod`**. His branch
was cut from `preprod`, which is what **New User Story** does when the target is `preprod`.

!!! danger "Never branch a hotfix from integration"
    `integration` carries next week's work. A fix branched from it ships next week's work to
    production tonight, on top of an incident, untested by anybody. This is the single most
    expensive mistake available in this lab, and the reason `preprod` exists.

### 3. Review the fix

Open the Pull Request, **Files changed** **(1)**. One file, the validation rule **(2)**, and the
change is the added line **(3)**:

![The Files changed tab of a Pull Request](../../_assets/annotated/web/github-pr-files.png)

```
  NOT(ISPICKVAL(Status__c, "Cancelled"))
```

A cancelled installation is finished work, exactly like a completed one, and the rule's own
description says finished work is exempt. Read it against the questions of [Lab 3.2](3-2-review-a-contributor-pull-request.md): it matches the
story, nothing disappears, and it is reversible in one line.

Small, and its blast radius fits in one sentence: **cancelled installations can be dated in the past
again, and nothing else changes.** That is a hotfix.

## Part 2: to production

### 4. Merge it into preprod

When the check is green, merge it with **Squash and merge**, from the arrow beside **Merge pull
request** **(1)**: Romain's branch is a fix, and a fix is squashed like every User Story
([Lab 1.6](../level-1-contributor-basics/1-6-pull-request-deployment-check-and-merge.md)). The promotion into `main` that follows is merged, not squashed.

![Merging a Pull Request on GitHub](../../_assets/annotated/web/github-pr-merge.png)

The deployment to `helios-preprod` follows on its own. That is the rehearsal, on an org that holds
what production holds, and it costs you two minutes.

### 5. Release preprod into main

A **+ PR** chip sits on each arrow between major branches in the DevOps Pipeline diagram. Click the
one on the arrow from `preprod` to `main` **(1)**:

![The + PR chip on the arrow from preprod to main](../../_assets/annotated/vscode/devops-pipeline-level3--release-to-prod.png)

Title it plainly, and use the word **Hotfix** rather than **Release**, so that a year from now the
list of Pull Requests into `main` says which ones went the short way:

> Hotfix US-045 to production

Its check deploys against production in validation mode, which is exactly what you want at 17:40:
the same gate, on the real org, taking two minutes.

### 6. Confirm it is live

Merge, and watch the **Process Deployment (sfdx-hardis)** run on `main`. When it finishes, the
sfdx-hardis comment says what reached the org: the banner **(1)**, the counts line **(2)**, and the
Quick Deploy line **(3)**: the merge released the validation its check had already run on
production, rather than deploying again. The picture is the comment of an earlier deployment, so
your counts are different.

![The sfdx-hardis comment on a merged Pull Request](../../_assets/annotated/web/github-pr-deployed.png)

Then confirm it the way you reproduced it: cancel an installation in `helios-prod`, back-date it,
and save. It saves. The planners can close their week.

**A deployment log is not a confirmation.** The log says what Salesforce accepted. Only the org says
whether the thing people complained about actually works now.

## Part 3: the retrofit

### 7. Start the retrofit branch

`main` and `preprod` carry the fix. `uat` and `integration` do not. Leave it there and the next
story from `integration` that touches this rule deploys the old formula over it, and the incident
comes back on a day nobody is expecting it.

It is yours to do, not a contributor's: you are the one who knows what went live tonight, and a
conflict between a hotfix and work in progress is a release manager's call.

In the **DevOps Pipeline** panel, under **Project Contribution Workflow** **(1)**, click **New User
Story** **(2)**:

![The contribution cards of the DevOps Pipeline panel](../../_assets/annotated/vscode/pipeline-cards--new-user-story.png)

Take the third branch type, **Retrofit: merge production back down into the pipeline after a hotfix
(release manager)** **(1)**:

![The branch type question, with Retrofit](../../_assets/annotated/vscode/work-new-story-type--retrofit.png)

| Question       | Your answer                                                     |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Target branch  | `integration`, the branch the retrofit goes back into           |
| Type of branch | **Retrofit**                                                    |
| Name           | `US-045-retrofit`, the story whose hotfix you are bringing back |
| Org to work in | `helios-dev`: nothing is built here, so the org hardly matters  |

It creates `retrofit/US-045-retrofit` from the latest `integration`. The prefix is a line in
`branchPrefixChoices`, and it tells everybody reading the branch list that this is production coming
back down, not new work.

### 8. Merge main into it

First make sure your machine knows what went live. Open the **Command Palette** (**View > Command
Palette**, or `Ctrl+Shift+P`, `Cmd+Shift+P` on a Mac), type `Git: Fetch` and pick **Git: Fetch**
**(1)**:

![Git Fetch in the Command Palette](../../_assets/annotated/vscode/git-palette-fetch--fetch.png)

Then the Command Palette again, type `Git: Merge`, and pick **Git: Merge...** **(1)**:

![Git Merge in the Command Palette](../../_assets/annotated/vscode/git-palette-merge--merge.png)

It asks which branch to merge. Pick **origin/main** **(1)**, listed under **remote branches**:

![The branch picker, with origin main](../../_assets/annotated/vscode/git-retrofit-pick--origin-main.png)

!!! danger "origin/main, not main"
    `main` on its own is the copy on your machine, which you have not updated since before the
    hotfix, and merging it brings nothing down. `origin/main` is what production just deployed.
    The list marks the remote ones, and this is the click the whole lab turns on.

Tonight this merges on its own: nobody else touched that validation rule this week. When it does
conflict, it is because somebody changed the same lines in `integration`, and the answer is the one
from [Lab 2.7](../level-2-contributor-advanced/2-7-resolve-a-git-merge-conflict.md): open each file under **Merge Changes**, **Resolve in Merge Editor**, and keep both
intents, the hotfix exception **and** whatever `integration` added. Neither side loses its work.

### 9. Publish it, and merge it into integration

**Save / Publish User Story**, as in [Lab 1.5](../level-1-contributor-basics/1-5-retrieve-commit-and-publish-your-changes.md). When it finishes, the actions bar along the bottom
starts with **Create Pull Request** **(1)**. Beside it sit the `package.xml` the command generated
**(2)** and the deployment actions of this Pull Request **(3)**: on a retrofit both are short, because
a retrofit carries what production already has and declares nothing new.

![The end of Save / Publish, with its actions bar](../../_assets/annotated/vscode/work-save-completed.png)

Open the Pull Request into `integration`, title it `Retrofit: US-045 back down into integration`,
wait for its checks, and merge it. `integration` now carries everything production carries, and the
next story built on it cannot take the fix away.

<details markdown="1"><summary>Under the hood: the hotfix and the retrofit, in commands</summary>

**The hotfix** used nothing special. Romain ran `hardis:work:new` with `preprod` as the target
branch, which cuts his branch from `preprod`, and `hardis:work:save` computed the package against
`preprod`. The pipeline treats `preprod` as any other major branch. What makes it a hotfix is the
target, not a mode.

The branch prefix is worth a second of thought, for a reason beyond tidiness: the DORA **rework
rate** of [Lab 3.6](3-6-release-to-production-and-read-dora-metrics.md) counts hotfix Pull Requests, and recognises one by a `hotfix/`, `fix/` or
`bugfix/` branch prefix. This project calls its fix branches `fix/`, so this one counts.

**The retrofit** is Git from end to end, and nothing is retrieved from any org:

    git checkout -b retrofit/US-045-retrofit origin/integration
    git fetch origin
    git merge origin/main
    # solve conflicts if git reports any, then commit
    git push -u origin retrofit/US-045-retrofit

The direction is the whole point. Work normally flows **up**, from a story branch to `integration`
to `uat` to `preprod` to `main`. A retrofit is the one thing that flows **down**, and it exists
because a hotfix joined the pipeline above the branches the team works on.

**Do it the same night.** A retrofit put off until Monday is a retrofit that collides with a week of
new work, and the merge stops being a formality.

## What you should see

- `helios-prod` saves a back-dated cancelled installation
- Three Pull Requests in your fork, in this order: into `preprod`, `preprod` into `main`, and the
  retrofit into `integration`
- The same `NOT(ISPICKVAL(Status__c, "Cancelled"))` line on `preprod`, on `main` and on
  `integration`

## If it goes wrong

**The Pull Request of the hotfix targets `integration`.**
The simulation opens it into `preprod`. If you see `integration`, you are looking at a different
Pull Request: check its head branch is `fix/US-045-installation-date-hotfix`.

**`origin/main` is not in the branch picker.**
VS Code has not fetched it. Run **Git: Fetch** again, then **Git: Merge...**. Nothing in your files
changes when you fetch.

**The merge brought nothing down.**
You picked `main` rather than `origin/main`. Run **Git: Merge...** again and take the entry listed
under **remote branches**.

**The retrofit Pull Request shows hundreds of changed files.**
Your branch was cut from something other than the latest `integration`. Delete it and start step 7
again: **New User Story** always branches from the latest target.

**The check of the retrofit fails on a deployment error.**
Read it the way [Lab 3.3](3-3-deploy-to-integration-and-read-the-log.md) taught. A retrofit deploys what production already has, so an error here is
almost always a component that `integration` changed and `main` has not seen, not the hotfix itself.

## Check your work

**Training: Level 3** > **Check my work**.

It looks for the `Cancelled` exemption on `preprod` and on `main`, and for the same line on
`integration`: the hotfix shipped, and the retrofit brought it back down.
