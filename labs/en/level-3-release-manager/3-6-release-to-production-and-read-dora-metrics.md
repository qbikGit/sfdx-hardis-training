# Lab 3.6 - Release to production and read your DORA metrics

**Level**: 3 Release Manager

**Time**: ~35 min

**You will**: release to production, and then measure whether your pipeline is any good.

## The situation

UAT signed off. The release goes to production this evening.

This is the same mechanism as [Lab 3.5](3-5-promote-to-uat-and-write-release-notes.md), twice: `uat` into `preprod`, then `preprod` into `main`. With one
difference that is not technical: if you get it wrong, real people cannot do their jobs tomorrow.
Everything in this lab that looks like ceremony is there because somebody skipped it once.

## Before you start

- [ ] [Lab 3.5](3-5-promote-to-uat-and-write-release-notes.md) finished: `uat` carries the release and the testers signed it off
- [ ] `helios-preprod` and `helios-prod` connected, seeded, and configured as the `preprod` and
      `main` orgs in Lab 3.1
- [ ] JWT authentication working for `preprod` and `main`

## Steps

### 1. Check the three things that are worth checking

Before creating anything:

**One: is UAT genuinely signed off?** Not "the deployment was green". Somebody tested it and said
yes. On this project that person is you, and you did it in [Lab 3.5 step 6](3-5-promote-to-uat-and-write-release-notes.md#6-verify-with-a-testers-eyes).

**Two: what manual steps will this carry?** Look at the deployment actions of the stories going out.
A manual step in production is something you will do, live, in front of nobody, at whatever time the
release is. Know about it now.

**Three: is production where you think it is?** Open `helios-prod` and look. It should carry what
the course seeded into it and nothing else yet. On a real project, admins change production by hand
between two releases, and [Lab 3.7](3-7-hotfix-and-retrofit.md) is about exactly that. Assume nothing.

### 2. Rehearse in preprod

The same way you created the promotion in [Lab 3.5](3-5-promote-to-uat-and-write-release-notes.md): the **+ PR** chip on the arrow from `uat` to
`preprod`, in the DevOps Pipeline diagram. GitHub opens on the Pull Request from `uat` into
`preprod`.

Its check job is the first one to log into `helios-preprod`, and it does so with the key and the
secrets of [Lab 3.1](3-1-configure-the-pipeline-up-to-production.md): a green check here is your `preprod` JWT set-up working.

Title it plainly:

> Promotion 2026-09 to preprod

Its first check stops **red**, on purpose, the way the promotion to `uat` did in
[Lab 3.5 step 4](3-5-promote-to-uat-and-write-release-notes.md): the deliverability step of US-026 runs before the deployment, and nobody has done
it in `helios-preprod`. Do the click there, tick its box in the sfdx-hardis comment (or **Mark as
done in preprod** in the VS Code **Deployment Actions** tab), then **Re-run all jobs** on the check.
It goes green.

Read the check, merge, and watch the **Process Deployment (sfdx-hardis)** run on `preprod`. Then
open `helios-preprod` and do the checks of step 6 there first.

This is what `preprod` is for. It holds what production holds, nobody works in it, and a release
that deploys there cleanly and behaves has very little left to surprise you with in production. A
release that fails here has cost you nothing.

### 3. Create the production Pull Request

The **+ PR** chip on the arrow from `preprod` to `main`, from `preprod` into `main`. Its check job is
the first JWT login into `helios-prod`. Title it plainly:

> Release 2026-09 to production

Its first check stops red for the same reason as in step 2, in the last org where nobody has done
the deliverability step: `helios-prod`. Do the click in production, tick the box, **Re-run all
jobs**, and read the green check that follows.

### 4. Read the check like it matters

When the check finishes, read the sfdx-hardis comment the way [Lab 3.2](3-2-review-a-contributor-pull-request.md) taught, and add two questions
that only apply to production:

| Question                     | Where to look                                                                                                               |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Does it delete anything?** | The `deleted` figure in the counts line. A deletion in production is permanent and takes data with it                       |
| **How long will it take?**   | The check duration is a reasonable estimate. If it is 40 minutes, that is 40 minutes during which the org is being modified |

If that figure is not zero and you were not expecting it, **stop**. The comment will not tell you
what is going: `manifest/destructiveChanges.xml` and the diff will. Find out what it is and who
intended it. That is not being careful, that is the job.

### 5. Merge, and stay

Merge. The **Process Deployment (sfdx-hardis)** run starts, this time on `main`.

Watch it. Not because you can do anything while it runs, but because knowing whether it failed at
minute two or minute thirty-five changes what you do next.

When it finishes, do the post-deployment manual steps, if any, then check the org. The
pre-deployment ones belong before the merge: do them, tick their boxes in the check comment, then
merge, and the deployment job records them, as in [Lab 3.5](3-5-promote-to-uat-and-write-release-notes.md).

### 6. Verify in production

Open `helios-prod` from **Orgs Manager**: find it by its alias **(2)**, check it says **Connected**
**(3)**, then **Open** from the actions menu at the end of its row. A disconnected row offers
**Reconnect** in that same menu; **Add Org** **(1)** is for an org the table does not have.

![The Orgs Manager table, with the alias and connection state of each org](../../_assets/annotated/vscode/orgs-manager.png)

Then check, the same as UAT and with more care:

- The two stories work
- Something that was already working still works: open an installation, check the timeline
  component, save a record

That last check exists because the most common production incident after a release is not the new
feature failing. It is an old one.

### 7. Now measure the pipeline

You have shipped. The question a release manager gets asked next is "how are we doing", and it
deserves a better answer than a feeling.

**Point yourself at `helios-prod` first.** Open **Orgs Manager**, find the `helios-prod` row, and
choose **Set as Default Org** in its actions menu. The report measures whatever org you are pointed
at: run it while `helios-dev` is your current org and you get a report about your sandbox, correctly
formatted and completely irrelevant.

Then open the **DevOps Pipeline** panel, click the gear **(1)** at the top right, and choose
**Generate DORA Metrics Report**. The menu holds three entries and you have used the other two:
**Pipeline Settings** in [Lab 3.1](3-1-configure-the-pipeline-up-to-production.md), **Add/Configure Org** in [Lab 3.1](3-1-configure-the-pipeline-up-to-production.md).

![The gear button at the top right of the DevOps Pipeline panel](../../_assets/annotated/vscode/devops-pipeline--settings-menu.png)

It covers the last 90 days by default, and it reports five numbers, not four:

| Metric                     | What it actually counts                                                      | What good looks like                                                                        |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Deployment Frequency**   | Successful deployments recorded **in the org**, divided by the period        | Weekly is fine. Quarterly means every release is enormous                                   |
| **Lead Time for Changes**  | Per Pull Request: its creation, to the deployment that landed within 14 days | Days, not weeks. A long lead time means work is sitting somewhere                           |
| **Change Failure Rate**    | Failed deployments divided by all deployments                                | Below 15%. Above that, the check is not catching what it should                             |
| **Mean Time to Recovery**  | Median hours, despite the name, from a failed deployment to the next success | Hours                                                                                       |
| **Deployment Rework Rate** | Hotfix Pull Requests, and deployments that follow a failure within a day     | Low. Read the note below before you expect [Lab 3.7](3-7-hotfix-and-retrofit.md) to move it |

Two of those are not what the names suggest, and it is worth knowing which. **Change failure rate
here is a deployment failure rate**: a release that deployed green and broke production on Tuesday
does not appear in it. **Mean Time to Recovery is the gap between a broken deployment and a working one**,
not between an incident and its fix. They measure your pipeline, not your org.

### 8. Read what is there, and know what is missing

You have shipped once. On a fresh production org, that is roughly what the report will show: a
handful of deployments over a 90 day window that was empty until this week, the ones **Set up one of
my training orgs** made to seed `helios-prod` and your release. There is no curve to read yet, and a
report that says so is telling the truth.

That is the honest version of this step, and it is also the point. A DORA report on a pipeline that
has run once is an empty baseline. It becomes useful at the fourth or fifth release, when the numbers
have somewhere to move from. Take the baseline now.

The report is a file, `docs/dora/dora-report-<date>.md`, and the panel opens it for you. Keep it
where it is: it is rebuilt from the org and the Pull Requests whenever you run the report again, so
nothing is committed, and [Lab 3.11](3-11-capstone-run-a-weekly-release-cycle.md) compares the next one with this one. The file is named after the day,
so a second report on the same day replaces it: if you go on to [Lab 3.11](3-11-capstone-run-a-weekly-release-cycle.md) today, note the five numbers
first, or copy the file under another name.

<details markdown="1"><summary>Under the hood: where the DORA numbers come from</summary>

The command was:

    sf hardis:doc:dora-report

and it reads **two** sources, which is the thing to know about it:

- **Salesforce**, through the Tooling API: every `DeployRequest` on the target org in the period,
  with its status and its dates, ignoring validation-only runs. Deployment frequency, change failure
  rate and time to restore are computed from that and from nothing else
- **The git provider**, for the merged Pull Requests into the current branch. Lead time pairs each
  one with the first successful deployment that completed within 14 days of its merge. The rework
  rate uses the branch names, recognising a fix by a `hotfix/`, `fix/` or `bugfix/` prefix, and it
  takes the larger of that count and the deployments that followed a failed one within 24 hours

So it does not read `productionBranch`, it does not read `developmentBranch`, and it has no idea
which of your orgs is production. **The org you point it at is the scope.** Point it at a sandbox
and it will measure the sandbox, cheerfully.

**One thing to check on any project.** The rework rate recognises a corrective change by its
branch name, and it looks for `hotfix/`, `fix/` or `bugfix/`. This project names its fix branches
`fix/`, so the hotfix you ship in [Lab 3.7](3-7-hotfix-and-retrofit.md) counts. Rename that prefix to something else and the
metric quietly reads zero, with no warning. A number built on branch names is only as good as the
naming convention, which is worth checking before quoting one at anybody.

Two degradations worth recognising rather than debugging:

- **No target org**: the three Salesforce metrics read "No data available" and the report still
  prints
- **No git provider token**: it falls back to reading `git log`, recognising the merge commits of
  GitHub and GitLab and the squash commits of GitHub and Azure DevOps. Lead time then reads zero:
  a commit carries the day it was merged, and not the day its Pull Request was opened

The report lands in `hardis-report/` and is copied to `docs/dora/`.

The numbers are honest in a way a dashboard somebody fills in by hand never is. Nobody can improve
deployment frequency by editing a spreadsheet. They are also narrower than the DORA names suggest,
and a release manager quoting them should know which part they cover.

## What you should see

- `preprod` and `main` carrying the release
- A green **Process Deployment (sfdx-hardis)** run on `preprod`, then one on `main`
- The stories working in `helios-prod`
- A DORA report measured against `helios-prod`, in `docs/dora/`

## If it goes wrong

**The deployment to production fails on a component that worked in preprod.**
Production has drifted, or has something preprod does not: an extra validation rule, a record type,
real data that violates a new constraint. Read the error. This is the single most common production
deployment failure, and it is the argument for keeping preprod as close to production as you can.

**The deployment half-succeeded.**
Salesforce deployments are atomic per deployment, so this usually means a post-deploy action failed
after a successful deployment. The metadata is in, the action is not. Re-run the action, do not
re-run the deployment.

**The DORA report says "No data available" for three of the metrics.**
It had no target org. In **Orgs Manager**, set `helios-prod` as your default org, then open
**Generate DORA Metrics Report** again.

**The report is about the wrong org.**
Same cause, other direction: it measured your default org, which was not `helios-prod`.

**Lead time is zero or missing.**
No Pull Request data: there is no git provider token in the environment, and the `git log`
fallback cannot tell when a Pull Request was opened.
