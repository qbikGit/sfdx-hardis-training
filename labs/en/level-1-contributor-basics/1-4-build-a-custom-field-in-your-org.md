# Lab 1.4 - Build a custom field in your Salesforce org

**Level**: 1 Contributor basics

**Time**: ~15 min

**You will**: build US-014 the way an admin builds anything, by clicking in Salesforce Setup, and
check it against real records.

## The situation

You have a branch and an org. Now do the actual work. Nothing in this lab is specific to CI/CD:
this is ordinary Salesforce configuration. The only rule is **where** you do it: in `helios-dev`,
your own org, never in the shared one.

## Before you start

- [ ] [Lab 1.3](1-3-start-a-user-story-on-a-git-branch.md) finished: you are on `features/US-014-panels-required`
- [ ] The Status section of the sfdx-hardis panel shows `helios-dev` as the current org

## Steps

### 1. Open your org

In **Orgs Manager**, find the row whose **ALIAS** column says `helios-dev`. Read the alias, not the
address: none of the addresses says what the org is for. The Developer Edition org has an
`orgfarm-` string Salesforce invented, and the scratch orgs have two random words and a number, so
your four orgs look alike everywhere except in that column.

At the end of that row, click the chevron. It opens everything you can do to that org, and the first
entry is **Open** **(1)**.

![The actions menu of the development org in Orgs Manager](../../_assets/annotated/vscode/orgs-manager-actions.png)

Your browser opens the org, already logged in. No password, no login page: the extension used the
credential it stored when you connected the org in [Lab 1.2](1-2-create-your-dev-hub-scratch-orgs-and-pipeline.md).

Opening the org from this panel rather than from a bookmark is a habit worth forming. It is the
difference between "the org I meant" and "the org that happened to be open in that tab".

### 2. Create the field

In Salesforce: **Setup > Object Manager > Installation**, then **Fields & Relationships** **(1)**
in the left column, then **New** **(2)**.

![The Fields and Relationships page of the Installation object in Setup](../../_assets/annotated/salesforce/object-manager-fields.png)

The list you see is the object before your change. `Panels Required` is what you are about to add
to it.

| Setting        | Value                                                         |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Data Type      | **Number**                                                    |
| Field Label    | `Panels Required`                                             |
| Length         | 4                                                             |
| Decimal Places | 0                                                             |
| Field Name     | `Panels_Required` (Salesforce fills this from the label)      |
| Description    | `How many panels the crew has to load for this installation.` |
| Help Text      | `Ask the planner if this is empty.`                           |
| Required       | **no**                                                        |

The **Field Name** box is what Salesforce calls the API name, and it fills it from the label as you
type. It shows `Panels_Required`, without the `__c`: Salesforce adds that suffix to every custom
field when it saves, and the rest of this course, the metadata files included, calls the field
`Panels_Required__c`.

The field-level security screen arrives with **Visible** already ticked for nearly every profile.
Clear them: the checkbox in the **Visible** column header toggles the whole column, so click it once
to tick everything and again to leave nothing ticked. Then click **Next**. You are going to grant
this through a permission set, not a profile, and [Lab 2.6](../level-2-contributor-advanced/2-6-permission-sets-and-profiles.md) is about why that
distinction matters more than it looks.

On the page layout screen, **Installation Layout** is already ticked, which is what puts the field on
the record. Leave it.

Click **Save**.

!!! tip "Fill in Description and Help Text"
    Two seconds now, and the generated project documentation at Lab 3.9 reads like something
    written by a person. Empty descriptions are the most common reason that documentation is
    useless.

### 3. Grant it to the crew, and to the planners

The acceptance criteria say the crew must see it, and planners must fill it in. Nobody has it yet,
not even you: you granted nothing, and a field that no permission grants is invisible to everybody,
the administrator who created it included.

**Setup > Permission Sets > Helios Delivery Crew**, then **Object Settings** **(1)** and
**Installations**, then **Edit**.

![Object Settings for Installations on the Helios Delivery Crew permission set](../../_assets/annotated/salesforce/permission-set-object-settings.png)

**Field Permissions** is the table that matters, one row per field, and **Read Access** **(2)** is
the column you are here for. This picture was taken before the field existed, so `Panels Required`
is not in it yet: after your change it appears in that list, in alphabetical order.

Find `Panels Required` and tick **Read Access**. Leave **Edit Access** unticked: a crew member
reads how many panels to load, they do not decide the number.

**Save**.

Then the same screens on **Helios Delivery Manager**, the planners' permission set. It is also the
one **Set up my training environment** gave you, which is how you see the Helios app at all. Tick
both **Read Access** and **Edit Access** on `Panels Required`: planners are the people who decide
the number. **Save**.

Skip this and step 4 shows you nothing: you would be looking for a field your own permission set
does not grant.

### 4. Put it where people will look

The field is on the layout, which is what old-style Salesforce pages use. The Installation record
page is a Lightning record page, and the column of fields on its left is that layout, so you are
already done.

Open any installation (**App Launcher > Helios Delivery > Installations**, pick `INST-00001`) and
look at the bottom of that column. `Panels Required` is there, empty, with the small **i** of the
help text you wrote next to its name.

### 5. Test it against real data

Empty fields prove nothing. Put a number in.

![An installation record in the Helios Delivery app](../../_assets/annotated/salesforce/installation-record.png)

The **Installations** tab **(1)** is how you get back to this list from anywhere in the app. On the
right of the record sits the **Panel delivery timeline** **(2)**, which lists the pallets booked for
this installation with their quantities. The picture was taken before this story existed, on an
installation with no pallet booked, so there is no Panels Required in its column either. Most
installations have two or three pallets.

1. On `INST-00001`, click the pencil at the right of **Panels Required**, type the number the
   timeline adds up to, and click **Save** at the bottom of the page. This page has no **Edit**
   button: every field is edited in place, with its own pencil
2. Look at the two numbers side by side. On a real story you would ask the planner whether this
   field should be typed in or worked out from the pallets. Here, typed in is the story, and that
   question is exactly the one a good contributor asks before building anything

Do the same on two more installations, so you have something to look at after the deployment.

## What you should see

On three installations: a `Panels Required` value, visible in the column of fields, saved without
error.

And in VS Code, **nothing at all**. The repository does not know about any of this yet. Your
changes live in one org and nowhere else, which is exactly the state [Lab 1.5](1-5-retrieve-commit-and-publish-your-changes.md) exists to end.

## If it goes wrong

**Object Manager does not list Installation.**
You are in the wrong org. Check the Status section in VS Code, then reopen the org from **Orgs
Manager**.

**You click Open and no browser tab appears.**
Older versions of the extension could fail to open the org without saying why. Update the
extension, which is what **Auto Update** in [Lab 1.1](1-1-install-vs-code-and-sfdx-hardis.md) is
for, and click **Open** again. Until then there is a second way in: in the **Status** section of the
sfdx-hardis panel, under **Current Org**, click the first line, the address of the org. It opens
your default org, which is `helios-dev` here.

**Orgs Manager shows your scratch orgs as disconnected, and offers Reconnect instead of Open.**
Older versions of the extension read only the connection probe, which a scratch org never carries:
its Dev Hub answers for it instead. Update the extension, which is what **Auto Update** in
[Lab 1.1](1-1-install-vs-code-and-sfdx-hardis.md) is for, then click **Refresh** in the panel. The
orgs are fine either way, and **Reconnect** would have signed you in again for nothing.

**The field does not appear on the record page.**
You skipped the page layout step. **Setup > Object Manager > Installation > Page Layouts >
Installation Layout**, drag `Panels Required` into the Information section, **Save**.

**Save fails with a validation rule error.**
The Helios org has a rule that refuses moving an installation date into the past. If you edited the
date by accident, put it back to a future date.

**The permission set has no Object Settings for Installation.**
A permission set only lists an object once something in it is granted. Use **Field Permissions** at
the top of the page instead: pick `Installation` there, and the object appears with its fields.

## Check your work

Welcome page > **Training: Level 1** > **Check my work**, then pick **Lab 1.4**.

Nothing of your work has left the org yet, so the check reads the org itself: it asks `helios-dev`
whether `Panels_Required__c` exists on Installation and whether `Helios_Delivery_Crew` can read it.
The repository learns about the field in the next lab.
